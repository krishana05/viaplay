I had an option to choose either React or Angular as framework but I went with React
because its a simple application with only one route, so not much configuration needed.

Steps to run:
1. npm install
2. npm run build
3. npm run start

Now open http://localhost:8000/ to see the loaded application as server side rendering

And open http://localhost:3000/ to see the loaded application as client side rendering

Please read README.md for more detail configurations.
